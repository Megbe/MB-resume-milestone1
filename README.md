Maggie Bejnar – MS-1 Resume
The intention was to create a flag page for the future employers of the CV key aspects such as development skills and work experience and which would constitute a step preceding the access to view the CV itself. It will be used to present my employment history and skills, which will be added once the diploma is completed. 
Currently, the key points are:
-	Basic HTML, CSS and Bootstrap knowledge
-	Employment history points inclusive of dates, positions and places I have worked for


##*UX*
Easy to navigate to find information dur to clear lay out of the page.
Maintain visibility by allowing to open the CV download page and LinkedIn access, in separate pages. 
Hover function navigation tabs and footer icons allow better visibility. 


##*FEATURES*
The website has a responsive fixed-top navigation bar in the header, which enable easy navigation without scrolling down and up the page to reach jump points like work history and contact form. 
The icons in the navigation bar feature a change of colour form white to blue when user hovers over each name in the nav bar tabs, to enhance interactivity.
The Footer has copyright information, media and a CV download icons, and colours transition from white to green when hovered over.

Colours used for the navigation tabs, footer and for the background of name/title and profile, stem from the colours in the main image and visually balance the web page design. 
Layout – the aim was to produce very simple easy to navigate page.
