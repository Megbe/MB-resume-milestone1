Maggie Bejnar – MS-1 Resume

The intention was to create a flag page for the future employers of the CV key aspects such as web development skills and work experience and which would constitute a step preceding the access to view the CV itself. It will be used to present my employment history and skills, which will be added once the diploma is completed. 
Currently, the key points are:
-	Basic HTML, CSS, JS and Bootstrap knowledge
-	Employment history points inclusive of dates, positions and places I have worked for

##**UX**
The website aims at my future employers, showcase main development skills and other employment experience, the step before reading my CV. Enable easy contact we me in the form section.  
Easy to navigate to find information dur to clear lay out of the page.
Maintain visibility by allowing to open the CV download page and LinkedIn and Facebook access, in separate pages. 
Hover function navigation tabs and footer icons allow better visibility. 

##**FEATURES**
The website has a responsive fixed-top navigation bar in the header, which enable easy navigation without scrolling down and up the page to reach jump points like skills work history and contact form. 
The contact form requires the input of name and email before submission by clicking on the “Send Request” button of the text that will be sent over to me. After message is sent, it returns with confirmation message that the email has been sent and with the link to return to the home page. 
The Footer has copyright information, media and a CV download icons. Icons’ colours, transition from white to green when hovered over. 

##**TECHOLOGIES USED**

##**TESTING**

-	Problems -from GitHub menu
-	Navigation links 
-	Links to CV pdf and LinkedIn and Facebook pages open from the footer and navbar in new windows.  I have tested them by clicking on the icons/tabs.
-	Clicked tabs in navbar like skills, history and contact will jump to position of their relevant heading. I have tested them by clicking on them both in large and small screen views. 
-	 Form was tested by completing individual fields and clicking on submit button which takes the user to the next page that opens up in the separate window to confirm that the form was sent and provides a clickable like to return to the home page. It was also tested by omitting individual fields before sending the form. When fields are omitted form comes up with the error message and prevents from sending the form before all fields are completed.
